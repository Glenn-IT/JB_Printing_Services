# Cancel Order Approval Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive cancel order approval system that allows customers to request order cancellations and requires admin approval before the cancellation is finalized.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Customer Side (orders.php)

- **Cancel Request**: Customers can request order cancellation for orders with 'pending' or 'confirmed' status
- **Cancel Reason**: Customers must provide a reason for cancellation (optional but encouraged)
- **Status Display**: Shows the current status of their cancellation request
- **Admin Response**: Displays admin messages when cancellation is approved/disapproved
- **Re-request**: If cancellation is disapproved, customers can submit a new cancellation request

### 2. Admin Side (admin/placed_orders.php)

- **Cancel Status Column**: New table column showing cancellation status
- **Pending Requests**: Orders with pending cancellation requests are highlighted
- **Review Modal**: Comprehensive modal for reviewing cancellation requests
- **Approval/Disapproval**: Admin can approve or disapprove cancellation requests
- **Admin Messages**: Admin can add custom messages for customers
- **Email Notifications**: Automatic email notifications sent to customers

### 3. Database Schema Updates

Added the following columns to the `orders` table:

- `cancel_reason` (TEXT): Customer's reason for cancellation
- `cancelled_at` (DATETIME): Timestamp when cancellation was requested
- `cancel_approval_status` (ENUM): 'pending', 'approved', 'disapproved'
- `admin_response_message` (TEXT): Admin's message to customer
- `cancel_processed_at` (DATETIME): When admin processed the request

## Workflow

### Customer Cancellation Request:

1. Customer clicks "Cancel Order" button
2. Modal opens asking for cancellation reason
3. Order status changes to 'cancelled' with approval_status = 'pending'
4. Admin receives notification in admin panel

### Admin Review Process:

1. Admin sees orders with pending cancellation requests
2. Admin clicks "Review" button to open approval modal
3. Modal shows:
   - Order details
   - Customer's cancellation reason
   - Text area for admin response message
4. Admin can:
   - **Approve**: Order status remains 'cancelled', customer gets refund
   - **Disapprove**: Order status reverts to original, processing continues

### Customer Notification:

- **Approved**: "Your cancellation has been approved. Refund will be processed."
- **Disapproved**: "Your cancellation was disapproved. Order will continue processing."

## Technical Implementation

### Email Integration

- Uses existing `sendOrderStatusEmail()` function
- Sends notifications for both approval and disapproval
- Includes admin messages in email content

### UI/UX Enhancements

- Color-coded status badges
- Responsive modal design
- Clear visual indicators for different cancellation states
- Intuitive admin interface

### Security Features

- User ID validation for all operations
